                <br><br>

                <p>After looking at inspiration (bottom) to get a sense of what professional porfolios actually look like out there, I was able to come up with a design style that I thought would be appropriate for my own site. Since the navigation menu was going to be a crucial part of the website (as it mut be consistent across all of my inner pages), I spent extra time on considering the design. Using the Bootstrap in-built navigation bars,I would be able to customize the center-alignment and hamburger collapsible menu. I wanted to keep the navbar as sticky, so the user would have easy access to it regardless of which section of the site I was on. I chose this as opposed to an additional side navigation as I thought that would ruin the flow of content on the pages, as well as cover some art/design examples that I wanted to  showcase in some image-based inner pages.</p><br>

                <img class="shadow-sm mx-4" src="images/Adobe XD/Assets.png" alt="design assets"><br><br><br> 
                <p>I went with a colour palette that had two primary standout colours (almost complementary for higher contrast and readibility) of pink and navy. The rest of the swatch would be filled with shades of those two colours (as well as a dark grey as a classic buffer) to allow for more harmonious blend of colours that is a happy medium between too high-brow and static (i.e. black and white, monochrome, or muted tones) and still fun, yet professional with the consistency throughout. The choice of "Lato" font was due to its simplistic, sans-serif properties that are easier for screen readers, yet with sufficient styles to allow for stylistic customization, thanks to it being a Google font. 
                <br><br>
                Other items such as the fade-in effect (or drop-shadows, rounded corners, easing transition etc.) of elements on the page, or most notably the change of navbar styles upon scroll — were just additional things that I thought were visually appealing and wanted to incorporate, but also gave me a chance to learn more about Javascript coding and getting to experiment a little bit of that on my own.
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <br>
                <p>Keeping in mind the requirements for this project, I knew that each inner page needed to be distinct in their content organization style, yet maintain an overall consistency that is on-brand with the rest of the website. That being said, I wanted to incorporate components that we had used in our labs and tutorials thus far. In the end, I settled on a Home/Landing page (index.html) that would be the face of the website, with a snappy headline and hero-sized display, as well as a highlight showcase to give a positive first impression upon encountering my portfolio. This sets the tone for the following pages, including a gallery/image-heavy page featuring some of my design work (artwork.html), which utilizes a container fluid as to make room to feature the visual elements on the page. 
                <br><br>
                Next is the "About Me" page, which is a basic profiling/blurb about myself (and I used a profile image that I animated myself, as a personification of me), and I kept this rather simple with text, a blockquote, and a simple carousel of my design skillset, all contained within a neat column-based container.
                <br><br>
                For the time-based page, I chose too make a blog-style page (blog.html) with text entries and a thumbnail image that would be neatly organized into flex columns and rows, and include relevant information such as the category of information (to use as future tags for filter, perhaps) upon hovering the image. A button linking to the full article is also provided, to lead into the full content. This was a page of personal importance, because I realized that as much as it is important to consider artistic skill and design aesthetics, it is equally important to consider the actual content and message of what is being designed. Therefore, this section is dedicated to some of the work that I have done in areas like sustainability and gender inequality (for non-profits etc.). Its importance is highlighted as the link to this inner page is highlighted in the landing page. 
                <br><br>
                Finally, the contact page was just a simplistic form that is filled with placeholder information for now (as I am not really collecting data yet, nor have I truly decided what it is I want to know from people who are connecting to me on my profile — business or employment opportunities? Collaboration with peers? etc.).
                </p><br><br>

            <h5>WEB ACCESSIBILITY</h5><hr>
                <img class="shadow mx-4" src="images/Adobe XD/iPhone.png" alt="web home layout">
                <br><br>
                <p>The first piece to considering accessibility was to ensure that I was either using the in-built Bootstrap framwork components for responsiveness and accessibility, or manually creating code (using HTML and CSS) that would  function on different screen sizes. In creating my own custom codes, there were many instances in which I had to resize elements manually, targeting classes and using @media screen size to change the styles of elements accordingly, all the while testing periodically using the browser's inspector settings.
                <br><br>
                Other AODA standards such as text contrast and sizing were considered when selecting the colour palette and font family, and I made sure to include alt text for all images to account for the case that images cannot be seen and understood, the content will still be conveyed through text. Also, I used both the footer and sticky navbar to have dual, easy access to main pages in the site across all inner pages. Since my pages are not too long yet, I felt there was no need to add a "back to top" button, but this is a consideration for the future. 
                <br><br>
                In addition, links on hover and when clicked were purposely made strong (bolded) and a highlight color, along with other elements like underline/overline as to make active links optimized for high-contrast, definitive visibility.
